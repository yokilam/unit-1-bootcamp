#Bonus Challenges

###Exercises

#### FizzBuzz
> 1. [Project Euler #1 - Multiples of 3 and 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)
> 2. Modify this code to write FizzBuzz. Print out each of the numbers from 1 to 1000. If the number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz" instead of the number. If the number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz" instead of the number. If the number is divisible by both then print "Fizzbuzz".
> 3. Modify this code again: instead of replacing numbers if they are divisible by 3 and 5, print "Fizz" if the number contains a 3 and "Buzz" if the number contains a 5, and "Fizzbuzz" if it contains both.
> 4. Read [this](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest) for more on FizzBuzz.

#### Collatz
> 1. [Project Euler #14 - Longest Collatz sequence](https://projecteuler.net/problem=14)
> 2. Modify this code so that it takes in the starting number as a parameter.
> 3. Modify this code so that it prints out each chain.
> 4. Modify this code so that it only prints out the longest chain found so far, whenever a new longest chain is encountered.
> 5. Modify this code so that it only prints out the longest chain under the starting number.
> 6. See also: [Collatz Conjecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)

#### Weekdays
> 1. [Project Euler #19 - Counting Sundays](https://projecteuler.net/problem=19)
> 2. Find a Java date library and solve this problem again, using that library.
> 3. Find another Java date library. Implement this solution again, using the new date library.
> 4. What day of the week were you born?
> 5. Read more about [programming and time](http://infiniteundo.com/post/25326999628/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time).

#### Currency
> 1. [Project Euler #31 - Coin sums](https://projecteuler.net/problem=31)
> 2. How many different ways can you make $2 with American coins?
> 3. How many different ways can you make $2 with [Canadian coins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coins_of_the_Canadian_dollar)?
> 4. Read more on [dynamic programming](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/dynamic-programming-from-novice-to-advanced/) and the coin change problem.
